- In React, the useReducer hook is a built-in hook that allows you to manage state using a reducer function. It is an alternative to the useState hook for more complex state management scenarios.

- The useReducer hook takes two arguments: the reducer function and the initial state value. It returns an array with two elements: the current state and a dispatch function.

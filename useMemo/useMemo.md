- In React, useMemo is a hook that allows you to memoize the result of a computation so that it is only recomputed when its dependencies change. It is used to optimize the performance of your React components by avoiding unnecessary calculations.

- The useMemo hook takes two arguments: a function and an array of dependencies. The function represents the computation that you want to memoize, and the dependencies are the values that the memoized function depends on.

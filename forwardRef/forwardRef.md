- In React, the forwardRef function is a built-in utility that allows you to pass a ref from a parent component to one of its child components. It is used when you need to access the underlying DOM element or React component instance of a child component directly.

- The forwardRef function takes a component as its argument and returns a new component that can accept a ref prop and forward it down to the underlying child component.
